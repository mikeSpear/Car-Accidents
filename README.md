# Car-Accidents
A trend based analysis of injuries and accidents ranging from an analysis of the initial business question through to the final report.

This was based on a case study I was given. Thise case study requested that a local government has requested that I analyse their data to reduce car accidents. This client believes that reducing total road acidents is the primary KPI they should be focusing on and that deaths and injuries will reduce as a result.
