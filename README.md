# Car-Accidents
A trend based analysis of injuries and accidents ranging from an analysis of the initial business question through to the final report.

This was based on a case study I was given. Thise case study's question was "A group of local governments has decided they want to reduce car accidents. They have hired you to assist them in doing this by analyisng their data and looking for actionable insights. This client believes that if they reduce total accidents, there will be a reduction in injuries and road deaths, therefore they have made it into their primary KPI"
